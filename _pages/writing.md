# Writing
<p>Writing is something we all must do in one way or another and for me it came later in life. I met a young man in the 80's , Luke Davies (of "Candy" fame), who influenced me to write poetry and I've gone from there, on and off, when in the mood. One of my favourite things to do is write monologues and it was useful for theatre auditions.</p>
<p>Nowadays I plan on creating animation with monologue as digital performance pieces. However overall I tend towards writing musical theatre, short stories and poetry. Below are three published works..</p>
<p>These are the latest published works in 2023. 
  
  An ebook of poetry with AI imagery available <a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/bZzRTKxCAv4HRSrr6">here and most places</a>
  Also there are NFTs created of these images that have as a collectible the above ebook. <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/charlie-bunt-poetry-ai-imagery'</a>
  And a short story about a child's miraculous encounter.</p>
