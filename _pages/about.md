Charlotte was born in Sydney, Australia on July 14, 1960 and grew up in Key Biscayne, Florida.  She learned to play the piano as a child and loved listening to music and making up stories. Early on she became involved in theatre and began touring schools while still at school. Returning to Australia her love of acting continued and she worked professionally in theatre in Canberra as well as Sydney. Later as a Mum, she created a puppet theatre named 'Toybox Puppet Theatre' which toured schools and festivals. During this time she started to teach herself web design and developed a love for animation and digital art.
