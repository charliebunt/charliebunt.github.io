# Acting
<p>As a child I began acting in the living room using the house curtains as a stage set and farted and giggled my way through 
until my parents gave up on me. At aged 12 my mother sent me to drama classes in America and the following year I had my first audition for the part of a witch in a kid's show to be toured to underprivileged schools in Miami. It was then I felt my first real rush performing and seeing the power of the exchange between myself and the audience. I was HOOKED! This theme of playing in schools has continued throughout my life interspersed with theatre for adults surrounding topics such as domestic violence, suicide and gay pride. </p>
