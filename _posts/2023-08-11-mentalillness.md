How hormones and histamines play a part in mental illness.

"On the other hand, the histamine system is likely to be involved in the pathophysiology of several psychiatric diseases such as BD. Histamine is a neuromodulator involved in arousal, motivation, and energy balance; drugs acting on the histamine receptor H3 have shown potential as antidepressants and antipsychotics.12 June 2018

This has been my personal theory for some time now and the reason is because I have a loved one that has bipolar and gets relapses always during the Spring when histamines are rife. Of course it goes without saying that hormones also play a part in how our body reacts to everything and often as we get older we can get a tolerance to things that once we reacted to severely.

It makes sense then that drugs that suppress the nervous system would also make mild or eradicate the symptoms for allergy to histamines in the air. Anti-histamines speed up the system with ephidrine like drugs and then in turn relax the body.

People with severe mental illness when in relapse are given Sedative drugs but also ones that usually decrease dopamine the "good feel" in the brain. The anti psychotics often do not even work during a relapse and instead must be coupled with strong sedatives.This is where I believe there needs to be a change. If mental illness is indeed linked with histamines, it makes sense to introduce drugs more like antihistamine and work on healing the gut prior to Spring time and watch for signs in people who are crossing over from teens to adult when mental ilness is most prevalent with regards to Psychosis. The stomach is intrinsically linked to histamines also and often reflux occurs in individuals who stop taking sedative medication.
